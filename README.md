# 01-Guessing
The purpose of this project is to create a simple number guessing game that will give you some practice with user input, variables, and simple control structures.

In this project, we explored how to generate random numbers by using Python. ALong with that, I was also instructed on how to create a new repository and how meticulous each piece of code is.
